Temperature and light intensity sensible Ambilight

The goal of our mini project is to develop an “Ambilight” for a complete room. In order to create a comfortable ambient, we use the room temperature and the current light intensity to control the color and luminosity of the LEDs.  Additionally, we’re going to develop an Android app to control the LEDs via WLAN or Bluetooth. We will add various lighting profiles and the ability to add user-defined profiles from inside the app.
